# MATLAB Simulations for comparison of Uncoded and (6,3) linear block coded systems

The (6,3) linear block code with below given generator matrix is used for coded system

```
G = [ 1 0 0 1 1 1
      0 1 0 1 1 0
      0 0 1 1 0 1]
```
To run the code in MATLAB, open command terminal of MATLAB and run `main` .
